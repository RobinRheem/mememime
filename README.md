This project will be a generified image processing server. Planning to make this server able to process images on the fly, and even make a bulk upload client. Hope this project makes a lot of developers live's better!

## TODO
* How to truly optimize images/videos/music -> Maybe you could make a compression algorithm lol.
* Cropping and compression on the fly & CDN stuff.
* Thinking about the processer & resource server.
* How does binary data get passed on the web.
* How does binary data processed when uploading and downloaded in the server & vise versa.
